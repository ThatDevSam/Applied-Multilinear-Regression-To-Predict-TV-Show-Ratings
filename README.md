# Applied-Multilinear-Regression-To-Predict-TV-Show-Ratings

In this case study I acted as a data scientist for a streaming service, Streamist, and was tasked with building a predictive model to predict the rating on new anime content and identify the most important factors for this prediction. To perform this task, I utilized Python's Pandas library for data manipulation, and Sklearn's linear regression and recursive feature selection libraries to build the prediction model.

Key Take Aways: 
There are about **30 key features** that can be used to effectively predict the rating of a new anime in this data set.

A few of them include:
*   The duration of an episode in minutes. 
*   If there is a content warning or not.
*   If the anime is based on a Manga. 
*   The studio that produced the show. 

Business Applications:
* **Marketing** - Predicting which shows are likely to receive high ratings can significantly enhance the marketing strategy. Allocating advertising funds to promote content expected to be well-received will ensure a healthy return on investment.
*   **Content Selection** - In today's increasingly competitive and costly streaming landscape, users are becoming more discerning about where they spend their time and money. By predicting which new shows are likely to resonate with the audience, Streamist can strategically enhance user engagement, retention, and overall satisfaction. This proactive approach not only ensures that Streamist is offering content that appeals to their viewers but also maximizes the return on their investment in content acquisition and royalty fees. 
*   **Recommendations** - By leveraging this prediction model, Streamist can effectively recommend new shows that have not yet established a rating. This proactive strategy ensures that promising new content gets the visibility it deserves. By promoting and recommending these high-potential shows to current users, Streamist can significantly enhance user engagement.
